Our family Dog: Mylo! 🐶

<!-- ![Mylo](images/Mylo.JPG) -->
Mylo is our 8 years old Lab who loves eggs, bananas, and barking at pigeons! Mylo also likes to sleep on our bed during cold winters. He is always happy!

Guitar 🎸
====
I love playing guitar, have been self-taught and playing since 2013. Performed on various gigs with my band prior to college. Mostly inspired by classic rock, rock, blues-rock, and a hint of metal.

Football/Soccer ⚽ 
====
I am a massive football fan, and follow Barcelona and the Premier League extensively. 2008-2014 was my favorite era of football. Messi is by far the GOAT but my favorite player is Neymar! I also am very good at Fifa.
