I am a 3rd year PhD Candidate at [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/), Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. I am advised by [Prof. Chen-Nee Chuah](https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/~chuah/rubinet/people/chuah/bio.html). I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering with a minor in Computer Science from UC Davis in December 2020.

**Research**: I primarily work in the domain of **Security and Privacy in Computer Vision**. My most recent works focus on Privacy-Preserving Computer Vision by **Image Anonymization** (quantification and synthesis) and **Domain Adaptation using Multi-Modal LLMs**. I have previously worked on research topics like **Adversarial Robustness**, **Neural Network Pruning**, **Model Extraction/Fingerprinting**. Currently, I am exploring **Foundation models** and **Multi-modal Understanding and Reasoning**.

**Previously**: I interned at [Sony AI](https://ai.sony/) - PPML team in summer 2023 under the mentorship of Dr. [Lingjuan Lv](https://sites.google.com/view/lingjuan-lyu/home?authuser=0) and Dr. [Vivek Sharma](https://vivoutlaw.github.io/index.html). I also interned at [Sony](https://www.sony.com/en/) - Imaging & Sensing under Mr. [Hideshi Yamada](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hideshi-yamada-3593aa101/?originalSubdomain=jp).
